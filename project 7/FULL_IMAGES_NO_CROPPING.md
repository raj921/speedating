# ✅ Full Images Display - No Cropping or Edge Cutting

## 🔧 **Problem Fixed**

### **Issue**: 
- Images were being cropped with `object-cover`
- Edges were cut off, couldn't see full image content
- Important parts of images were hidden

### **Solution**:
- Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
- Added proper container sizing with `min-height`
- Added background color for better presentation
- Centered images within containers

## 🎯 **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Image Display Method**
```css
/* BEFORE (Cropped) */
object-cover  /* Crops image to fill container */

/* AFTER (Full Image) */
object-contain  /* Shows complete image, no cropping */
```

### **2. Container Structure**
```css
/* BEFORE */
height: fixed  /* Fixed height, image forced to fit */

/* AFTER */
min-height: fixed  /* Minimum height, image can be smaller */
```

### **3. Image Positioning**
```css
/* ADDED */
display: flex
align-items: center
justify-content: center
padding: 16px
background: gray-50
```
