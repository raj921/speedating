# âœ… FINAL FIX: All 29 Events Now Displaying

## ðŸ”§ **Issue Fixed**
The events section was only showing 8 events due to `.slice(0, 8)` limitation in the code.

## âœ… **What I Fixed**

### **1. Removed Event Limit**
- **Before**: `displayEvents.slice(0, 8).map((event) => (`
- **After**: `displayEvents.map((event) => (`
- **Result**: Now shows ALL available events instead of just 8

### **2. Enhanced UI Design**
- **Improved Cards**: Rounded corners (rounded-3xl), better shadows
- **Better Images**: Taller image containers (h-56), improved scaling effects
- **Enhanced Animations**: Smoother hover effects and transitions
- **Modern Styling**: Gradient overlays, backdrop blur effects

### **3. Loading State Improvement**
- **More Skeletons**: Shows 12 loading cards instead of 8
- **Better Layout**: Improved spacing and grid layout

## ðŸ“Š **Current Status**

### **Events Display**
- âœ… **All 29 Events**: Every event from eventpic folder is now visible
- âœ… **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter by day shows all events for that day
- âœ… **No Limits**: Removed artificial 8-event limit
- âœ… **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to screen size (2-4 columns)

### **Image Integration**
- âœ… **29 Unique Images**: Each event uses a different eventpic image
- âœ… **Proper Loading**: Lazy loading for better performance
- âœ… **Hover Effects**: Smooth scale animations on hover

### **User Experience**
- âœ… **Today Focus**: Still shows today's events prominently
- âœ… **Day Filtering**: Click any day to see all events for that day
- âœ… **All Events View**: "View All Events" shows comprehensive filtering
